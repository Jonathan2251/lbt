LLD changes quickly and the figures of this chapter is not up to date.
Like llvm, lld linker include a couple of target in ELF format handling.
The term Cpu0 backend used in this chapter can refer to the ELF format handling 
for Cpu0 target machine under lld, llvm compiler backend, or both. But
supposing readers will easy knowing what it refer to.

  Code generation and execution flow

As depicted in :numref:`lld-f-workflow` of chapter About. Beside llvm backend,
we implement ELF linker and elf2hex to run on Cpu0 verilog simulator.
This chapter extends lld to support Cpu0 backend as well as elf2hex to replace
Cpu0 loader.
After link with lld,
the program with global variables can be allocated in ELF file format layout. 
Meaning the relocation records of global variables is resolved. In addition, 
elf2hex is implemented for supporting generate Hex file from ELF.
With these two tools supported, the global variables exists in 
section .data and .rodata can be accessed and transfered to Hex file which feeds  
to Verilog Cpu0 machine and run on your PC/Laptop.

As the previouse chapters mentioned, Cpu0 has two relocation models for static 
link and dynamic link, respectively, which controlled by option 
``-relocation-model`` in ``llc``. 
This chapter supports the static link.

About lld please refer LLD web site here [#lldweb]_ and LLD install requirement 
on Linux here [#lld-install]_. 
Currently, lld can be built by: gcc and clang compiler on Ubuntu. 
On iMac, lld can be built by clang with the Xcode version as the next sub 
section.
If you run with Virtual Machine (VM), please keep your phisical memory size 
setting over 1GB to avoid insufficient memory link error.

    }
  }


Setup Cpu0 backend under lld
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please download lld from llvm web 
[#llvm-download]_ and put lld 
souce code on {llvm-src}/tools/lld just like we download llvm and clang as 
shown in Appendex A of book "Tutorial: Creating an LLVM Backend for the Cpu0 
Architecture" as follows.

.. code-block:: console

  1-160-136-173:tools Jonathan$ pwd
  /Users/Jonathan/llvm/test/src/tools
  1-160-136-173:tools Jonathan$ ls
  ...
  lld              llvm-config      llvm-extract    llvm-nm           llvm-stress   obj2yaml

Next, setup Cpu0 backend as follows,

.. code-block:: console

  1-160-136-173:lld Jonathan$ pwd
  /Users/Jonathan/llvm/test/src/tools/lld
  1-160-136-173:lld Jonathan$ cp -rf ~/test/lbt/exlbt/lld/* .

Now, build lld with Cpu0 backend as follows,

.. code-block:: console

  1-160-136-173:cmake_debug_build Jonathan$ cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -
  DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-std=c++11 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
  -G "Xcode" ../src
  ...
  -- Targeting Cpu0
  ...
  -- Configuring done

  -- Build files have been written to: /Users/Jonathan/llvm/test/cmake_debug_build

If using VM (guest machine is Linux) or Linux, build as follows,

.. code-block:: console

  [Gamma@localhost cmake_debug_build]$ cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -
  DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-std=c++11 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

LLD introduction 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general, linker do the Relocation Records Resolve as Chapter ELF support 
depicted, and optimization for those cannot finish in compiler stage. One of 
the optimization opportunities in linker is Dead Code Stripping which is 
explained as follows, 

.. rubric:: Dead code stripping - example (modified from llvm lto document web)

.. rubric:: a.h
.. literalinclude:: ../exlbt/input/a.h

.. rubric:: a.cpp
.. literalinclude:: ../exlbt/input/a.cpp

.. rubric:: ch13_1.cpp
.. literalinclude:: ../exlbt/input/ch13_1.cpp

Above code can be reduced to :numref:`lld-deadcodestripping` to perform
mark and swip in graph for Dead Code Stripping.

.. _lld-deadcodestripping: 
.. figure:: ../Fig/lld/deadcodestripping.png
  :scale: 40 %
  :align: center

  Atom classified (from lld web)


As above example, the foo2() is an isolated node without any reference. It's 
dead code and can be removed in linker optimization. We test this example by 
build-ch13_1.sh and find foo2() cannot be removed. 
There are two possibilities for this situation. 
One is we do not trigger lld dead code stripping 
optimization in command (the default is not do it). The other is lld hasn't 
implemented it yet at this point. It's reasonable since the 
lld is in its early stages of development. We didn't dig it more, since the 
Cpu0 backend tutorial just need a linker to finish Relocation Records Resolve 
and see how it runs on PC.

Remind, llvm-linker is the linker works on IR level linker optimization. 
Sometime when you got the obj file only (if you have a.o in this case), 
the native linker (such as lld) have the opportunity to do Dead Code Stripping 
while the IR linker hasn't.


Static linker 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's run the static linker first and explain it next.

File printf-stdarg.c come from internet download which is GPL2 license. GPL2 
is more restricted than LLVM license. 
File printf-stdarg-1.c is the file for testing the printf() function which
implemented on PC OS platform. Let's run printf-stdarg-2.cpp on Cpu0 and
compare it against the result of PC's printf() as below.

.. rubric:: exlbt/input/printf-stdarg-1.c
.. literalinclude:: ../exlbt/input/printf-stdarg-1.c
    :start-after: /// start

.. rubric:: exlbt/input/printf-stdarg-2.cpp

    :start-after: /// start

.. rubric:: exlbt/input/functions.sh
.. literalinclude:: ../exlbt/input/functions.sh

.. rubric:: exlbt/input/build-printf-stdarg-2.sh
.. literalinclude:: ../exlbt/input/build-printf-stdarg-2.sh

.. rubric:: lbdex/verilog/Makefile
.. literalinclude:: ../lbdex/verilog/Makefile


The build-printf-stdarg-2.sh is for my PC setting. Please change this script to
the directory of your llvm/lld setting. After that run static linker example 
code as follows,

.. code-block:: console

  1-160-136-173:input Jonathan$ pwd
  /Users/Jonathan/test/lbt/exlbt/input
  1-160-136-173:input Jonathan$ bash build-printf-stdarg-2.sh cpu032I be
  In file included from printf-stdarg-2.cpp:11:

                ^
  1 warning generated.
  
  1-160-136-173:input Jonathan$ cd ../../lbdex/verilog/
  1-160-136-173:verilog Jonathan$ pwd
  /Users/Jonathan/test/lbt/lbdex/verilog
  1-160-136-173:verilog Jonathan$ make
  1-160-136-173:verilog Jonathan$ ls
  ... cpu0Is ... cpu0IIs ...
  1-160-136-173:verilog Jonathan$ ./cpu0Is
  Hello world!
  printf test
  (null) is null pointer
  5 = 5
  -2147483647 = - max int
  char a = 'a'
  hex ff = ff
  hex 00 = 00
  signed -3 = unsigned 4294967293 = hex fffffffd
  0 message(s)
  0 message(s) with \%
  justif: "left      "
  justif: "     right"
   3: 0003 zero padded
   3: 3    left justif.
   3:    3 right justif.
  -3: -003 zero padded

Let's check the result with PC program printf-stdarg-1.c output as follows,

.. code-block:: console

  1-160-136-173:input Jonathan$ clang printf-stdarg-1.c
  printf-stdarg-1.c:58:19: warning: incomplete format specifier [-Wformat]
    printf("%d %s(s)%", 0, "message");
                    ^
  1 warning generated.
  1-160-136-173:input Jonathan$ ./a.out
  Hello world!
  printf test
  (null) is null pointer
  5 = 5
  -2147483647 = - max int
  char a = 'a'
  hex ff = ff
  hex 00 = 00
  signed -3 = unsigned 4294967293 = hex fffffffd
  0 message(s)
  0 message(s) with \%
  justif: "left      "
  justif: "     right"
   3: 0003 zero padded
   3: 3    left justif.
   3:    3 right justif.
  -3: -003 zero padded
  -3: -3   left justif.
  -3:   -3 right justif.

They are same. You can verify the slt instructions is work fine too by change 
variable cpu from cpu032I to cpu032II as follows,

.. rubric:: exlbt/input/build-printf-stdarg-2.sh


.. code-block:: console

  1-160-136-173:verilog Jonathan$ pwd
  /Users/Jonathan/test/lbt/lbdex/verilog
  1-160-136-173:verilog Jonathan$ cd ../../exlbt/input
  1-160-136-173:input Jonathan$ pwd
  /Users/Jonathan/test/lbt/exlbt/input
  1-160-136-173:input Jonathan$ bash build-printf-stdarg-2.sh cpu032II be
  ...
  1-160-136-173:input Jonathan$ cd ../lbdex/verilog/
  1-160-136-173:verilog Jonathan$ ./cpu0IIs

The verilog machine cpu0IIs include all instructions of cpu032I and add 
slt, beq, ..., instructions.
Run build-printf-stdarg-2.sh with cpu=cpu032II will generate slt, beq and bne 
instructions instead of cmp, jeq, ... instructions.

With the printf() of GPL source code, we can program more test code with it 
to verify the previous llvm Cpu0 backend generated program. The following code 
is for this purpose.

As above, by taking the open source code advantage, Cpu0 got the more stable 
printf() program. 
Once Cpu0 backend can translate the printf() function of the open source C 
printf() program into machine instructions, the llvm Cpu0 backend can be 
verified with printf(). 
With the quality code of open source printf() program, the Cpu0 toolchain is 
extended from compiler backend to C std library support. (Notice that some GPL 
open source code are not quality code, but some are.)

The "Overflow exception is printed twice meaning the ISR() of debug.cpp is 
called twice from ch4_1_2.cpp. 
The printed "taskInterrupt(001)" and "taskInterrupt(011)" just are trace 
message from cpu0.v code.


Dynamic linker 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I remove dynamic linker demostration from 3.9.0 because I don't know how to
do it from lld 3.9 and this demostration add lots of code in elf2hex, verilog 
and lld of Cpu0 backend. However it can be run with llvm 3.7 with the following 
command.

.. code-block:: console

  1-160-136-173:test Jonathan$ pwd
  /Users/Jonathan/test
  1-160-136-173:test Jonathan$ git clone https://github.com/Jonathan2251/lbd
  1-160-136-173:test Jonathan$ git clone https://github.com/Jonathan2251/lbt
  1-160-136-173:test Jonathan$ cd lbd
  1-160-136-173:lbd Jonathan$ pwd
  /Users/Jonathan/test/lbd
  1-160-136-173:lbd Jonathan$ git checkout release_374
  1-160-136-173:lbd Jonathan$ cd ../lbt
  1-160-136-173:test Jonathan$ git checkout release_374
  1-160-136-173:lbt Jonathan$ make html

Then reading this section in lld.html for it.


Summary
--------

Create a new backend base on LLVM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks the llvm open source project. 
To write a linker and ELF to Hex tools for a new CPU architecture is easy and 
reliable. 
Combined with the llvm Cpu0 backend code and Verilog language code programmed
in previouse chapters, we design a software 
toolchain to compile C/C++ code, link and run it on Verilog Cpu0 simulator 
without any real hardware investment.
If you buy the FPGA development hardware, we believe these 
code can run on FPGA CPU even though we didn't do it.
Extend system program toolchain to support a new CPU instruction set can be 
finished just like we have shown you at this point. 
School knowledges of system program, compiler, linker, loader, computer 
architecture and CPU design has been translated into a real work and see how it 
is running. Now, these school books knowledge is not limited on paper. 
We design it, program it, and run it on real world.

The total code size of llvm Cpu0 backend compiler, Cpu0 lld linker, elf2hex and 
Cpu0 Verilog Language is around 10 thousands lines of source code include 
comments. 
The total code size of clang, llvm and lld has 1000 thousands lines exclude the
test and documents parts. It is only 1 \% of the llvm size.
More over, the llvm Cpu0 backend and lld Cpu0 backend are 70% of same with llvm 
Mips and lld X86_64.
Based on this truth, we believe llvm is a well defined structure in compiler 
architecture. 

Contribute back to Open Source through working and learning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, 10 thousands lines of source code in Cpu0 backend is very small in UI 
program. But it's quite complex in system program which based on llvm. 
We spent 600 pages of pdf to explain these code. Open source code give 
programmers best opportunity to understand the code and enhance/extend the 
code function. But it can be better, we believe the documentation is the next 
most important thing to improve the open source code development. 
The Open Source Organization recognized this point and set 
Open Source Document Project years ago [#BSDLicense]_ [#docproj]_ 
[#freebsdLicense]_ [#gnuLicense]_ [#fdl]_.
Open Source grows up and becomes a giant software infrastructure with the forces 
of company [#apple-opensource]_  [#ibm-opensource]_, school research team and 
countless talent engineers passion. 
It terminated the situation of everyone trying to re-invent wheels during 10 
years ago.
Extend your software from the re-usable source code is the right way. 
Of course you should consider an open source license if you are working 
with business.
Actually anyone can contribute back to open source through the learning process. 
This book is written through the process of learning llvm backend and contribute 
back to llvm open source project.
We think this book cannot exists in traditional paper book form since only 
few number of readers interested in study llvm backend even though
there are many paper published books in concept of compiler. So, this book 
is published via electric media form and try to match the Open Document License 
Expection [#gnu-phi]_.
There are distance between the concept and the realistic program implemenation. 
Keep note through learning a large complicate software such as this llvm backend 
is not enough. 
We all learned the knowledge through books during school and after school. 
So, if you cannot find a good way to produce documents, you can consider to 
write documents like this book. This book document uses sphinx tool 
just like the llvm development team. Sphinx uses restructured text format here
[#rst-ref]_ [#rst-directives]_ [#rst]_.
Appendix A of lbd book tell you how to install sphinx tool. 
Documentation work will help yourself to re-examine your software and make your 
program better in structure, reliability and more important "Extend your code 
to somewhere you didn't expect".
